# README for call_submit_jobs_scripts

Is is recommended to use the tmux submission script
`topollm/scripts/submission_scripts/call_submit_jobs_scripts/call_submit_jobs_for_experiments_via_tmux_submission.py`
for the pipeline jobs, since it is most flexible and currently the main script under development.

We also provide example scripts for one-off submissions in the directory `topollm/scripts/submission_scripts/call_submit_jobs_scripts/bash_scripts`.
