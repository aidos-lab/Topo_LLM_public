It's very unlikely that she picks a second winner, especially in what appears to be a less favorable upcoming macro environment.

AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, etc.  There are some large, but slightly smaller and slightly risker growth stocks I like long-term, but could get hurt in the near-term. Stocks like ABNB, CRM, PYPL, &amp; SHOP for example. These aren't going anywhere, but they're less defensive than the mega-caps.  Then you have the more speculative names, which honestly I'd avoid right now, but in theory under the right conditions could see huge returns in the coming years. Some quality speculative stocks would be CRWD, UPST, SNOW &amp; NET. These are great companies with huge growth potential, but near-term are likely to struggle given their valuations and less defensive nature.  If the company is trading on growth hype alone I'd avoid them completely regardless of the economic backdrop. Stocks like SPCE, for example. These are neither fundamentally good companies or reasonably valued. These stocks are basically a coinflip.  I guess it depends how long-term you're looking and how much risk you're willing to take. Honestly, I'm building cash positions right now because near-term I see no hope for this market, but until recently I've been holding the mega-caps and a few long-term high conviction growth names like SHOP and CRWD. If I were you and I was looking to buy growth stocks right now I'd probably wait for something I like to fall after earnings then buy it if you believe it's a long-term winner. I'd concerned that a lot of growth stocks are likely to see 10-15% declines from their current levels in the coming weeks. If SHOP falls to the low $600s after earnings I'd be buying for example.](/r/stocks/comments/txcgou/what_is_your_goto_growth_stock/i3m2ek1/)\n\nKEYWORD : GOOG DATE : Wed Apr  6 11:31:22 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Haven’t gone wrong with apple yet.

The bad: Yes, it can be cultish but don’t mind the people of Twitter or ST. Focus on the actual actions of DOL or the subsidiaries. DOL does need to stop being so block happy, but people do need to stop asking the same questions or questions that can get him/the company in trouble, people need to stop whining if the SP goes down a little bit. The market isn’t always a get rich over night scheme. Lastly, a little dilution here and there but I do believe DOL is calculated and wouldn’t be burning out his energy if he didn’t have anything brewing.

It's very unlikely that she picks a second winner, especially in what appears to be a less favorable upcoming macro environment.

Crypto sentiment has been seriously damaged by NFTs and Luna. $COIN is still profitable. ARKK is still holding $HOOD and $RBLX. GPUs are still selling above MSRP. Many of the ARKK holdings are itching for eventual bankruptcy and delisting. I'm seeing a lot of downside left to go on the ARKK holdings.

AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, etc.  There are some large, but slightly smaller and slightly risker growth stocks I like long-term, but could get hurt in the near-term. Stocks like ABNB, CRM, PYPL, &amp; SHOP for example. These aren't going anywhere, but they're less defensive than the mega-caps.  Then you have the more speculative names, which honestly I'd avoid right now, but in theory under the right conditions could see huge returns in the coming years. Some quality speculative stocks would be CRWD, UPST, SNOW &amp; NET. These are great companies with huge growth potential, but near-term are likely to struggle given their valuations and less defensive nature.  If the company is trading on growth hype alone I'd avoid them completely regardless of the economic backdrop. Stocks like SPCE, for example. These are neither fundamentally good companies or reasonably valued. These stocks are basically a coinflip.  I guess it depends how long-term you're looking and how much risk you're willing to take. Honestly, I'm building cash positions right now because near-term I see no hope for this market, but until recently I've been holding the mega-caps and a few long-term high conviction growth names like SHOP and CRWD. If I were you and I was looking to buy growth stocks right now I'd probably wait for something I like to fall after earnings then buy it if you believe it's a long-term winner. I'd concerned that a lot of growth stocks are likely to see 10-15% declines from their current levels in the coming weeks. If SHOP falls to the low $600s after earnings I'd be buying for example.](/r/stocks/comments/txcgou/what_is_your_goto_growth_stock/i3m2ek1/)\n\nKEYWORD : GOOG DATE : Wed Apr  6 11:31:22 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks\n\n\n\n[Haven’t gone wrong with apple yet.
