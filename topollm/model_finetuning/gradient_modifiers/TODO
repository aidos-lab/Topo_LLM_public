Implement the freezing of model layers by setting their gradient parameter to False.

Subtasks:
[x] Implement GradientModifierConfig
[x] Implement factory function
[x] Implement gradient modifier which freezes layers
[x] Apply gradient modifier to the model prior to fine-tuning
- Modify the trained model save paths to include the gradient modification information
