- Investigate correlation between local dimension estimates and perplexity/machine learning performance.
- Significance tests comparing local dimension estimates between original and fine-tuned model: Make the same tables for perplexity (and machine learning performance).

2024-07-10:

- Fine-tune on data that the model has seen during pre-training (for example on Wikipedia-data).
- Compute local measures by skipping the second subsampling step: 
  - Restrict to a small number of utterances.
  - Sample dialogues.
