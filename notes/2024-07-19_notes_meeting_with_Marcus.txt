- token-level perplexity distribution appears to be exponentially distributed
  --> which statictical methods/significance tests apply here?
- look at distributions of local topology measures and check whether they are always bimodal
- select model based on validation --> check on test set
- do not measure linear correlation, but use the monotonous correlation:
  - token level correlation analysis
  - "model-level" correlation analysis

# DONE

- align perplexity score with local dimension estimates - DONE
